# GLOSTFM
Spatiotemporal fusio

This repository contains the implementation of the Global Spatiotemporal Fusion Model (GLOSTFM), a novel approach designed to generate global Land Surface Temperature (LST) products by integrating data from multiple remote sensing sources. GLOSTFM leverages the strengths of both thermal infrared and microwave sensors, effectively addressing challenges related to spatiotemporal continuity, computational efficiency, and data uncertainty on a global scale.

## Overview
GLOSTFM is built on image pyramid principles and utilizes data from China's Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite, which is equipped with both thermal infrared (MERSI, 1 km) and microwave (MWRI, 25 km) sensors. By employing spatiotemporal fusion techniques, GLOSTFM enhances LST data continuity and accuracy, making it a powerful tool for global climate change research and monitoring applications, such as urban heat island analysis.

## Availability
The code and test datasets associated with GLOSTFM will be made publicly available after the associated research article is accepted for publication. Stay tuned for updates and additional resources!
